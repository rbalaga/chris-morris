    6.a: yes the information returned seems to be accurate showing chrome since I am using Edge Chromium
        
    6.b: I believe it looks like the web browser name, version, and user agent can change depending on the broswer opened in
    
    6.c: the navigator seems to try to detect aspects of a browser but even in edge chromium it mentions things like safari and mozilla so I don't 
        think it is acually a very accurate display of it and doesn't give you exact results.
